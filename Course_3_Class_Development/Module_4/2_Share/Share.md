# Exercise 13
## It's Nice to Share

### Problem 1 - Create two shared pointers

Declare two shared "pointers to float" variables. Initialize the first pointer using `new`. Print the value of the float the first pointer points to.

### Problem 2 - Set and output pointed to values

Set the second pointer to the first pointer and deference both pointers to print the value of the float they point to.

### Problem 3 - Change shared value

Change the value of the float the first pointer points to, then print the value of the float the second pointer points to.
