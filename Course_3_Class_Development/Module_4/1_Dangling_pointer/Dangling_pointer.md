# Exercise 12
## Don't Leave Me Dangling

### Problem 1 - Create and output a raw pointer

Declare a raw "pointer to float" variable and allocate memory for it using `new`. Print the value of the float the pointer points to.

### Problem 2 - Set, output, and delete a raw pointer

Deference the pointer to assign a value to the float the pointer points to. Print the value the pointer points to, then release the memory the pointer points to using `delete`.

### Problem 3 - Access a dangling pointer

Print the value the pointer points to. Notice that nothing is printed, and that the process DOESN'T exit with code 0 (which indicates successful completion) like it usually does.
