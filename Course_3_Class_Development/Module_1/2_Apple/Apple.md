# Exercise 2
## A Classy Apple

### The Problem

Develop an abstraction for a console app apple that the main function wants to eat. The main function likes all kind of apples, but it doesn’t like to ingest pesticides. Of course, once the apple is gone the main function doesn’t want to keep trying to eat it!

Start by figuring out the details that matter for this abstraction. After you’ve done that, figure out the fields, getters and setters, and functions your Apple class should implement. If you want to, you could even draw a UML class diagram of your Apple class.

### Note

The next few exercises will implement the design from this exercise.
