# Exercise 4
## Building an Apple

### The Problem

Implement the constructor for the Apple class weâ€™ve been working on in the previous two exercises. Remember, the constructor parameters should be whether or not the apple is organic and how large the apple is (which will be my initial value for how much is left to eat).

Add code to your main function to instantiate an Apple object and call the getters to ensure the constructor and getters are working correctly.
