# Exercise 9: 
## Yer Birthday


### Problem 1 – Birthday Fun

Create a new console application named whatever you want. Your program will read in a user’s birthday as a month (Jan, Feb, etc.) followed by the day and echo that information to the user. 

Start by prompting for and getting the month of the user’s birthday
- Print an appropriate message to the user asking for their birth month
- Read the value from the user and store it in an appropriate variable. Make sure the user enters a valid month

Next, prompt for and get the day of the user’s birthday
- Print an appropriate message to the user asking for their birth day
- Read the value from the user and store it in an appropriate variable. You should NOT be storing the day as a `string`. Make sure the user enters a valid day for their birth month; assume the user was NOT born in a leap year

Finally, print out the stored values to the user with an appropriate message

### Problem 2 – Reminders

Add code to display what day a reminder email will be sent to the user inviting them to visit an in-game store on their birthday for 20% off.  Your program must display that the reminder will be sent on the day before the user’s birthday. 

Specifically, your additional code should print a message to the user stating the month and day they will receive a reminder (see Hint below).

**Hint**:  What if the user puts in the first day of the month (e.g., July 1)?  What value will your application print?  You have to handle that special case in your solution.
