# Exercise 7

## The Runaway

### Requirements

Implement a game with a pawn that the player moves around with the keyboard (through a player controller). Start the pawn with 100 health.

Every time the pawn completely leaves the screen, move the pawn to location (0, 0, 0) and deduct 25 from the pawn's health. When the pawn's health reaches 0, destroy the pawn.

**Hint 1**: You should consider using ScreenConstants for the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right edges of the screen.

**Hint 2**: There's lots of code in the Using in a Game lecture that could help you solve this problem. Remember, you can download the lecture code from the Lecture Resources for that lecture

**Hint 3**: You shouldn't clamp the pawn in the screen; it's supposed to be able to run away
