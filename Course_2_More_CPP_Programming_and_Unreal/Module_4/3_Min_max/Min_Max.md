# Exercise 12
## Min and Max

### Problem 1 – Read in scores from user

Create a new C++ console app project named whatever you want in Visual Studio using the Windows Desktop Wizard or in Xcode.

Ask the user how many scores they want to enter (making sure they enter a positive number) and get that many valid (0-100) scores from the user, storing the scores in a vector.

### Problem 2 – Find the min and max scores the user entered

Walk the vector of scores to find the min and max scores in the vector.

Print out the min and max scores.

Hint: You might find it helpful to assume that element 0 of the array is both the min score and the max score before you start walking the array.
