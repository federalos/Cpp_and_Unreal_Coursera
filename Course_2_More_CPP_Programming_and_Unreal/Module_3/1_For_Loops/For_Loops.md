# Exercise 8
## For Loops

### Problem 1 – Print even numbers in user-specified range

Create a new C++ project named whatever you want in Visual Studio using the Windows Desktop Wizard or in Xcode.
Prompt for and get a maximum number from the user.
Print all the even numbers from 0 up to the maximum number (or 1 less than the maximum number if the maximum number is odd).

### Problem 2 – Print a row of asterisks that’s a user-specified max width

Prompt for and get a row width from the user.
Print a single row asterisks that’s the user-specified row width.
For example, if the user enters 5 your program should output:
```
*****
```

### Problem 3 – Print rows of asterisks that are a user-specified width

Prompt for and get a row width from the user.
Prompt for and get a number of rows from the user.
Print the appropriate number of rows of asterisks, with each row the user-specified row width.
For example, if the user enters 3 for the number of rows and 5 for the row width, your program should output:
```
*****
*****
*****
```
Coursera formatting makes it look like there are blank lines between the lines with asterisks above, but your output for this example should be exactly 3 lines of output.

Hint: You need to use nested loops in your solution. The good news is that the for loop in your solution to the previous problem is your inner for loop for your solution to this problem.

### Problem 4 – Print rows of asterisks up to user-specified max width

Prompt for and get a row width from the user.
Print rows of asterisks, adding 1 to the asterisk in each row, until you print a row of the user-specified row width.
For example, if the user enters 5 your program should output:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```
Coursera formatting makes it look like there are blank lines between the lines with asterisks above, but your output for this example should be exactly 5 lines of output.
