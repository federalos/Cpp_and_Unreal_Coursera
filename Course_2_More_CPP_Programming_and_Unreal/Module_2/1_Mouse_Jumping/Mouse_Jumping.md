# Exercise 5
## Mouse Jumping

[Here](/Course_2_More_CPP_Programming_and_Unreal/Module_2/1_Mouse_Jumping/Source/MouseJumping.uproject) you can find an source-project of task on UE4 (*.uproject).

### Problem 1 - Add an action mapping

`Select Edit > Project Settings` from the top menu and go to the Input section. Because we only need to recognize when the left mouse button is released, weâ€™ll add an Action Mapping. Click the + next to Action Mappings, then click the arrow to the left of Action Mappings to expand that section. Change the name of the new action mapping to JumpMiner and click the arrow to the left of the action mapping to expand the details for the mapping. Click the None dropdown and select `Mouse > Left Mouse Button`.

### Problem 2 - Finish the code

I've implemented all the code you need for your solution except for the code on the MinerPlayerController implementation file. Go add the required code under each comment I included in that file. You'll probably find the mouse input processing videos and/or Section 8.2 in the book Chapter 8 I provided in a reading useful as you do this.

### Problem 3 - Run the game

Run the game to make sure it works properly. Debug as necessary.
