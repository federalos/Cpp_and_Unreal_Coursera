# C++ Programming for Unreal Game Development Specialization

## By Dr. Tim "Dr. T" Chamillard, Associate Professor from  University of Colorado System at Coursera

This specialization consists of 4 courses that could help with access point to video game development

### [Course 1: Introduction to C++ Programming and Unreal](/Course_1_Introduction/Introduction.md)

Basic of IDE and: how to start work with VS and UE editor. First console application. First Unreal Engine project. 

That has to be mentioned that course is build on UE4. But nowadays it's relevant to use 5th version of the Engine. So I tried to build projects on UE5 instead of UE4.

### [Course 2: More C++ Programming and Unreal](/Course_2_More_CPP_Programming_and_Unreal/More_Unreal.md)

Another basic concept of C++ coding and UE such as: loops, Pawn Possession, Timer and Frames. 

### [Course 3: C++ Class Development](/Course_3_Class_Development/Class_Development.md)

*in progress*

### Course 4: Intermediate Object-Oriented Programming for Unreal Games

*pending*
