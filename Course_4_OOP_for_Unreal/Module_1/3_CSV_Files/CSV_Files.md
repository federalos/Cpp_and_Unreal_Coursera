# Exercise 3
## Practice Using CSV Files

### Problem 1 â€“ Create a console project and a csv file

Start up your IDE and create a new Console Application project named Exercise3. Save the project in a reasonable location on the computer. Build the project.

Use Google Sheets, Excel, Notepad++, Notepad, or some other application to create a csv file that contains 5 lines of name information. Each line in the file should have 3 comma-separated values: a first name, a middle name, and a last name. Save the file in the appropriate folder (see the Visual Studio and Xcode File Locations reading to figure out where that is for you).

### Problem 2 - Read name information from file

Add a `Name` class with a constructor and getters for first name, middle name, and last name. Write a function prototype (and the function implementation!) that extracts the name information from a csv string and returns a `Name` object.

Read the name information from the csv file, populating a `vector<Name>` with the information as you read each line.

### Problem 3 - Print name information

Print the contents of your `vector<Name>` variable using a for loop.
