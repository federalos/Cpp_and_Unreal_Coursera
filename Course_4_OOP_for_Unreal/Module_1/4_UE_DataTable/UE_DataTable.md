# Exercise 4
## Using an Unreal DataTable

### Getting Started

[Here](/Course_4_OOP_for_Unreal/Module_1/4_UE_DataTable/Source/UnrealDataTable.uproject) you can find an source-project of task on UE4 (*.uproject).

### Requirements

Refactor the project to use a csv and an Unreal DataTable to replace the MoveAmountPerSecond constant in the TeddyBearPawn header file with the value in the csv file.

We obviously usually have more than one configuration data value we're including in our csv file, but completing this exercise will give you practice with this approach without having you grind through the same set of steps to use more configuration data values in your code.

### Solution
[Here](/Course_4_OOP_for_Unreal/Module_1/4_UE_DataTable/Solution/UnrealDataTable.uproject) is solution on UE4 (*.uproject).
