# Exercise 9
## Who You Gonna Call?

### Problem 1 â€“ Create a console project

Start up your IDE and create a new Console Application project named Exercise9. Save the project in a reasonable location on the computer.

### Problem 2 - Declare and populate a map

Declare a map variable for a phone book that uses `std::string` as the key and `std::string` as the value. You'll need to add `#include <map>` in the appropriate place in your code.

Add a few elements to your phone book using either one (or both) of the techniques I showed you in the maps video.

### Problem 3 - Look up phone number

Prompt for and get a name from the user. Print out the phone number for the name or print a "phone number not found" message if the name isn't in the phone book.
